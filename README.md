# PF-Forecast
Profit First Cash Flow Forecast Repository

## Supabase setup

Use the SQL script in [`supabase/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema.sql) to create the
tables and views required by the app. The file can be executed from the Supabase
SQL editor or any PostgreSQL client connected to your project. After running the
script you can (optionally) uncomment the seed section at the bottom to load a
demo client with the core Profit First accounts and baseline allocation targets.
